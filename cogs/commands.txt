# The format is as follows:
# Command : Response

# Your commands may have spaces but if they contain a symbol (! in this case) at the start,
# it would be better to enclose them in speech marks.

# YOUR COMMANDS MUST BE IN LOWER CASE OR ELSE THEY WILL NOT WORK
# (Your response may be in whatever case)

# You must run the program again if you would like updates to this list to be noticed

# These are two examples, you may add as many as you would like and you may remove these ones
# Have fun!
